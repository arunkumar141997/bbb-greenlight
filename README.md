# bbb-gl

Read [the official document](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-install.html) to get started with Greenlight.

## Additional Features

In this extension of Grenelight, we provide the following features that were useful for us:
- First Name and Last Name in registration form
- Mobile number with country code in registration
- User role can only join a class that he is assigned to. In the default version, the user can also start a class. 
- User can't edit his profile. Think of it as students not allowed to change their names. 
- Build user upload from the command line (coming soon)
